<p>As strange as this may sound, I find it hard to understand how different frames of reference which coexist simultaneously in the same universe experience differing rates of time passing. Actually, after imagining a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BART</a> train car with ten people riding in it passing twenty people driving in cars on the freeway parallel to the train and parallel to thirty people riding bicycles on the back roads traversing vineyards, pastures, and oak forests. I imagine that there is slow traffic due to human-caused (due to slow reflexes) freeway congestion which makes the cars travel at approximately five miles per hour while the train (which I am riding on) is passing by the ground which both the cars and train are traversing on top of is traveling at approximately 60 miles per hour. If the train were screech to a sudden halt, all the people on that train would &#8220;fly&#8221; forward and so would their purses and phones and wallets. Why do those objects get pulled by gravity? Does space change density such that (<span style="background:#00ffff;">a congealing happens; objects are lumped together into one encompassing &#8220;blob&#8221;</span>), the more dense a region of space is compressed, the more gravity that region of space has in relation to the relatively less dense regions of space around it? Does gravity cause time to slow down because the matter is compressed so densely that matter is closer to becoming energy (and energy travels at the speed of light)? (These are just ideas that may or may not be ill informed. They just sound &#8220;trippy&#8221; to the person who is writing this note).</p>
