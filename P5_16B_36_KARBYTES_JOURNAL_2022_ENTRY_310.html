<p>While sitting in the garage at my dad&#8217;s house for a while tonight and drinking some coffee and smoking some weed and even getting the chance to sneak in a little soft drumming (because it was 10PM (yet it&#8217;s a Saturday night, so I figured it was okay so long as I was quiet (and I am actually quite good at controlling the volume now that I would call myself slightly better than ammeter as a drummer))), I got the idea to somehow incorporate the idea of karma and reincarnation into my &#8220;primary website&#8221; (i.e. <strong>Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</strong>). (To be honest, my &#8220;secondary website&#8221; (i.e. this website (i.e. <strong>Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</strong>)) is more important to me than is my &#8220;primary website&#8221; because my &#8220;secondary website&#8221; is designed to encompass all of the content inside of multiple versions of my &#8220;primary website&#8221; in addition to much more content which helps to tell a story I think is worth telling and which could not be told in any other way).</p>
<p>I believe that the following are useful &#8220;superstitions&#8221; to believe in (or to at least pretend to believe in):</p>
<p>1. The idea that each human being which has ever lived has lived for at least one life time and that each human being is very likely to (if not certainly guaranteed to) be reincarnated infinitely many times. Some people who are currently alive in the universe which I live inside of, for example, might have lived for 200 life times prior to this one while other people who are currently alive in the universe which I live inside of have lived for 10 life times prior to this one. (What that means is that there could be a ten year old child who currently lives in my universe who has been reincarnated 100 times but was given birth to by a biological parent which has only been reincarnated 10 times (which means that the soul of the child is older than the soul of the parent)).</p>
<p>2. The idea that people &#8220;level up&#8221;, &#8220;stay at the same level&#8221;, or else &#8220;level down&#8221; while transitioning from one life time to the next depending on the karmic debt that person has acquired and/or paid off. (My use of the word &#8220;karma&#8221; is basically synonymous with intelligence, merits, and a sense of having made some kind of valuable contribution to the unfurling of cosmic intelligence; using it to create &#8220;good&#8221; structures instead of &#8220;bad&#8221; structures. To improve one&#8217;s karmic credit score, one has to do things which foster health, freedom, and kindness as inclusively as possible. To diminish one&#8217;s karmic credit score, one has to do things which delay the proliferation of health, freedom, and kindness. The higher one&#8217;s karmic credit score, the more intelligent (i.e. agential) one&#8217;s next reincarnation will be. The lower one&#8217;s karmic credit score is, the less intelligent (i.e. agential) one&#8217;s next reincarnation will be. I personally do not believe in such a moralistic physical reality. Instead, I think that, if reincarnation exists, there is no linear continuity of life times, but rather, one &#8220;God head&#8221; getting the chance to incarnate as any character it wants to inside of any dream it conjures into existence. (It may be possible that the &#8220;God head&#8221; has no choice over what kinds of dreams it manifests and is forced to inhabit as various frames of reference).</p>
<p>3. <span style="background:#00ffff;">Panpsychism is the hypothesis that all of reality is contained within one mind (which means that pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness). Some notions of panpsychism (<strong>A</strong>) suggest that nature contains infinitely many unique phenomena simultaneously (and that nature contains infinitely many phenomenally identical instances of the same unique pattern)). By contrast, some notions of panpsychism (<strong>B</strong>) suggest that nature contains only a finite number of unique phenomena simultaneously (and that nature contains only a finite number of each phenomenally unique pattern). If A is true, then nature is static (i.e. unchanging) because it cannot encompass more or else less phenomena than what it already contains. By contrast, if B is true, then nature is dynamic (i.e. changing) because phenomena appear and disappear as time elapses (along the most macroscopic timeline in existence (i.e. nature&#8217;s frame of reference and not some frame of reference which is a subset of nature&#8217;s frame of reference whose scope is smaller than that of nature&#8217;s frame of reference)) rather than be instantiated unconditionally and eternally (relative to nature and not to some phenomenon which is smaller than nature). B suggests that nature can grow or shrink. A suggests that nature is exactly one size unconditionally (and that nature has neither a temporal beginning nor a temporal ending). A suggests that, from nature&#8217;s perspective, there is a phenomenal manifestation of each unique noumenon. B suggests that, from nature&#8217;s perspective, not every (abstract) noumenon has a uniquely corresponding (physical) phenomenon.</span></p>
