<p>As soon as I have sufficient funds to order a USB plug-and-play optical disc player and a stack of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M-discs</a>, I will order those items from the Internet and use them to make &#8220;End of The Year&#8221; backups of my website data before 01_JANUARY_2023 and store those read-only discs in a metal safe in my bedroom at my legal residence (i.e. my dad&#8217;s house at <span style="background:#ffff00;">4757 Mira Vista Place, Castro Valley, California 94546</span>) and <strong><em><span style="background:#ffff00;">also in my backpack</span></em></strong> (in case people break into by room to steal my M-discs)</p>
<p>The purpose of doing what I said in the previous paragraph is to give me &#8220;peace of mind&#8221; from knowing that I have access to at least one &#8220;hard copy&#8221; backup of my most valued possessions and crowning works of art: the personal websites named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>. I plan to make a backup of my websites (at least the new content which was not previously backed up) no more than once per year near the end of the year. Apparently the data which is inscribed onto an M-disc is retrievable for up to 1,000 (Earth) years (i.e. 1000 * 365 * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).</p>
