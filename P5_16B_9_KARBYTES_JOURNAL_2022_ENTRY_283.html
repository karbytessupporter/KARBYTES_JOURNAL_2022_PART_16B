<p>While charging my laptop at the electrical outlet on the sixth floor of the Dublin BART parking garage, I stood next to the window overlooking the residential area below and watched cars and people travel along the street from a bird-like perspective. I was talking to myself out loud (much to some people&#8217;s dismay) about what&#8217;s going on in my mind. I was thinking about how I might not be able to get a job until I finish the big &#8220;end of the year&#8221; website update because, until I do, I apparently have &#8220;too much&#8221; anxiety from having &#8220;too much&#8221; unfinished personal business which is making me appear to not be as work-ready as I ought to be (according to prospective employers). It&#8217;s like the prospective employers are implicitly telling me, &#8220;We are not here to serve you. Instead, you are here to serve us.&#8221; That would be in response to me telling them that I need a job in order to support me in completing my unfinished personal business (because, without a job, I hardly have enough money to make ends meet (which makes me anxious and angry)). &#8220;Do not bother applying for jobs until you finish whatever your personal business is so that you do not seem so angry and anxious and so that you can be more focused on being of service to your prospective employer,&#8221; I imagine my inner devil&#8217;s advocate saying to me. I would reply to that inner devil&#8217;s advocate saying, &#8220;It would be much easier for me to finish my personal business if I had a source of income other than my mother who has been threatening to reduce how much money she gives me if not stop altogether because (a) she is short on funds and (b) she is tired of financially supporting me and does not want me to be able to do things she disapproves of which costs money such as purchase magic mushrooms.&#8221; The devil&#8217;s advocate would reply, &#8220;Well, the world thinks you deserve to be completely and helplessly dependent on your mother for all your financial needs and that, if you rely on her for all of your money, then you are obligated to do whatever she wants (and you clearly are not doing what she wants you to do which is stay indoors at night, drive a car instead of walk, and hardly spend money on anything other than food).&#8221; I would say to the devil&#8217;s advocate in response, &#8220;The last few times I talked to my mother about getting a job, she always insisted that I apply for disability payments (seemingly so that I do not have enough money to have much of a life outside the home and so that I am relegated to the position of an invalid who is little more than a burden to society and someone who is too selfish and mentally disabled to contribute to society and to feel more included in society at large).&#8221; The devil&#8217;s advocate would reply, &#8220;Your mother does not really care what you do outside her vicinity. She does not care whether or not you have a job, friends, or hobbies. She is not necessarily trying to prevent you from having a life outside the home. She just wants you to figure things out on your own and not burden her with the details.&#8221; I would reply, &#8220;I would like to agree with you, but I do not think it is that simple. I think she has contradictory intentions and may not be cognizant that is the case. She seems desperate to frame me as having incurable and debilitating bipolar disorder so that I seem unlikely to ever move out of her house and have a full-time white-collar career. At the same time, she does not want to have to deal with me being in a bad mood because I feel so limited compared to how I think I ought to be in terms of employment, recreation, and housing. I do not think my mother consciously wants to sabotage my efforts to become as successful as I want to be, but I do think she wants to have more friends than me, more money than me, more material possessions than me, and more fun than me. In short, I think she needs me to be poorer than her and lonelier than her and sadder than her so that she can feel superior to me.&#8221; The devil&#8217;s advocate would say, &#8220;You need to stop bad mouthing the people who gave you life and who care for you more than anyone else ever has and likely ever will. Without your parents, no one but you would seriously give a fuck about your welfare. There is something wrong with you for not having friends your age (and you are 32 years old). You are too immature, self absorbed, and dependent on Mommy and Daddy to have a life outside the home. That is why you have no friends outside the home. You are just a big overgrown spoiled kid who is far behind everyone else your age. People think you are lazy, mentally ill, and anti-social. You are an uncomfortable person to deal with.&#8221; I would reply, &#8220;That&#8217;s why I do not have friends. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I do not think I really need friends. I just need to make sure I am prepared for emergencies and am a good survivalist.</span> I do not expect very many people to know nor care if and when I die. I do not need a funeral nor an obituary. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I just need to set and achieve my highest priority goals before I die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><em>At this time in human history, lots of human beings are suffering and struggling to survive while facing daunting hardships for much of their lives (if not for the vast majority of their lives). You, Karlina Ray Beringer, are not the only human being going through hardships. There is little you can do at this time to help people other than small and random acts of charitability here and there. You will likely never make a large-scale impact on human civilization; so get over yourself and stop complaining that you feel that you are hardly making a dent in the universe. Human civilization would carry on just fine without you in it. You are really not that essential to any person&#8217;s life other than yours and perhaps your parents&#8217;. In fact, you take up less space in other people&#8217;s lives than most other people do because you are more reclusive than most people are. If you want more people to care about you, you have to make more friends and show more interest in the lives of others and stop being so egotistical and stingy with your time, attention, and material resources. Otherwise, you deserve to be ignored, neglected, and daresay even tortured. Because you fail to be more involved in the lives of other people, you deserve to be punished (and other people do not owe you sympathy). In fact, it is good that other people be mean to you. You do not do enough to ingratiate yourself to other to be treated more kindly than you currently are. Get over yourself! You do not deserve to feel good about yourself. You do not deserve to pursue your personal development goals. Instead, you deserve to be relegated to a slave labor camp for the rest of your life and forced to put up with inhospitable and hazardous conditions.</em></p>
