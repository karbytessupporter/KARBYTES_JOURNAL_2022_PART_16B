<p>I decided to leave my weed smoking kit behind in a drawer in my desk in my room at my dad&#8217;s house. Smoking is not a habit I wish to continue maintaining (because smoking usually requires that I invest in petroleum lighters and because smoking damages the respiratory system and body in general). I will only smoke if it is the only means available to take some kind of powerful psychedelic (and I know that such opportunities are generally rare, spontaneous, or expensive). What is legally available and convenient for me to acquire now is shrooms and weed (both in edible form). Right now, I am trying to save as much money as possible for other things in my life. Like I said in an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier journal entry</a>, I will probably do shrooms no more often than once every month while on this low of a budget and while learning to spend money more strategically rather than in wasteful ways.</p>
