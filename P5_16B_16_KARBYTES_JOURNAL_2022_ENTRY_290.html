<p>I recently hiked back to my dad&#8217;s house and am now in the garage. I briefly visited my dad and Brea the cat (and Brea seems quite content after I fed her a can of cat food (and now she is sitting on the washing machine licking herself while my dad smokes a bowl in the room connected to the laundry room)). I was wondering why I did not make more extensive use of this house for my laptop-based activities. Then I remembered how I ran into frequent network errors while trying to make relatively large uploads and downloads (but streaming videos seems to work fairly well here). If I really put my mind to it, I would have invested in decent over-ear headphones and I would have been less paranoid about other people watching me and judging me. I have stayed out of the house in order to have more privacy, a better Internet connection, fresher air, and to avoid monotony. I think I should keep up that trend of spending more of my time away from the house because it seems to help me from feeling depressed and claustrophobic (and I do not want to spend too much time commuting to where I work). I am tentatively planning on camping in Dublin/Pleasanton within about a half hour&#8217;s walk of the store I expect to be working at. There are some relatively secluded and shady areas behind some corporate buildings where I can catch a few hours of sleep and some parking garages in that area where I had some success being able to catch a few hours of sleep during the day as well. I want to avoid using a tent as a shelter because tents tend to leak, are cumbersome to carry, and bow in the wind. I do not want to rely on my mom&#8217;s car as a shelter and as a means to commute because I do not want to be reliant upon something so expensive, flimsy, and bad for the environment.</p>
<p>Well, now that I am &#8220;home&#8221;, I will open up those online training modules at SmartFinal.csod.com and get as much of them done as possible tonight. (What is annoying is waiting for my dad to leave to go to my mom&#8217;s house like he said he would. It is uncomfortable knowing he is immediately on the other side of the wall just &#8220;loitering&#8221; and not doing anything other than smoking and sitting in his chair. I wish I lived on my own or with people who I did not feel were spying on me. I am trying not to be rude but I cannot wait for him to get out of my hair so that I can relax. I cannot help but wonder if he is deliberately trying to make me feel suffocated so that I do not succeed in life and end up remaining underemployed, poor, and deprived of personal space like he seems to be. This feels like a cold war which has been going on for years. This is why I have lived like a homeless person and not been even half as productive as I think I would otherwise be. It is hard to get into a flow state and to maintain good lifestyle habits when I feel this suffocated by people who I think want to hold me back and drive me insane. I think both my parents are secretly conspiring against me to prevent me from being as well as I want to be. It is very distressing. I just want to work. I noticed my dad has a smirk on his face which looks malicious and he walks very slowly and takes his sweet merry time to leave like he is intentionally being a menace. I feel so deprived of a home that I feel forced to move out and live somewhere else. I am afraid that if I try to set up camp at my mom&#8217;s house, he will try to loiter over me there too. If I bring this up with my mom, she accuses me of being mentally ill and excessively paranoid and in need of psychiatric intervention. If I bring it up with my dad, he plays dumb. Now I am convinced that he does want to make me feel deprived of personal space. This may be the single greatest stressor in my life).</p>
<p>Finally, I hear him driving away. There is no way I can make a living here. It is simply to stifling. There is always someone else in the house besides me and I cannot help but think that I am being spied on and treated like some kind of delinquent. (I remember hearing someone say that not a single line of code will come out of this house because people are, for whatever reason, opposed to me having a career and would prefer that I be forced to be underemployed, deprived of a decent office space, and deprived of the privacy and lack of environmental distractions and hazards I need to really relax and feel like I have a place to call home).</p>
<p>Some readers may say that I am being melodramatic, but I think I am being candid. Both my parents act creepy, in my opinion. I remembers back when I first started Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (or maybe even a year before that), I was sitting in my bedroom at my dad&#8217;s house with the door closed, the classical radio on, and writing JavaScript applications and thought I had everything I needed to be a self taught student with the means to control my own routine so that I can spend my time working on my personal goals. My dad seemed irritated around that time and was grumbling while pacing back and forth down the hall which creaks when people walk on it next to my bedroom. He also started peaking into my window a lot while appearing to be gardening, building a deck, and spraying Roundup. Lastly, I will not forget when my dad came to pick me up from Santa Rita Jail without notifying me and he decided to take my backpack containing my laptop, sleeping bag, and survival gear out of my room to hold hostage from me so that, after taking BART and walking home, I would discover that my most valued possession were missing. (Also, for three years following the incident in which I got into a fight with my mom in 2018 and threw a spoon at the back of her head, she filed a restraining order against me which forbade me from going to her house without my dad there to accompany me (and she called the cops on me at twice to have me arrested for showing up at her doorstep and asking for money)). Last year she apparently canceled the restraining order such that I am now allowed to use her house as a place to hang out, but she had my old bedroom renovated such that it now looks like a couple&#8217;s hotel room with a giant queen sized bed taking up most of the floor space where my smaller bed and desk used to be (and she had someone paint over the green and black designs which I painted on the walls and other traces of my identity from that room). It seems that my parents are on a tag-team, all-out mission to obliterate my sense of self, to smear my reputation, and to prevent me from flourishing.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Regardless of all I have said, my parents (and all other people I have accused of wanting me to suffer) might have never intended to sabotage my educational, vocational, and health goals (which would mean that I am only imagining they are).</span> Nevertheless, I think it is wise for me to trust my intuition and say that I feel that, if I spend too much time at either one of my parents&#8217; houses, I feel violated, harassed, and set up to fail. That is why I always sleep somewhere other than my parents&#8217; houses. Deep down, I do not trust them to respect my boundaries. They routinely go through my mail and &#8220;accidentally&#8221; open envelopes, move my stuff back and forth between there houses without telling me, and I have noticed a lot of my stuff mysteriously vanish. I feel that I have no one to turn to for help and that I am dealing with this adversity all alone. If I lived with the best friend I ever had (i.e. my ex partner <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spencer Eugene Dyer</a>), I am pretty sure I would not have any of these problems. I would have a safe, comfortable place to live and a sense of privacy I have been sorely lacking for years.</p>
