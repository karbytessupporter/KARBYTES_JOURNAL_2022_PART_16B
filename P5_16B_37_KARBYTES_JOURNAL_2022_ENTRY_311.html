<p>I arrived back at my camping spot (i.e. the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turkey Tree</a>) in Dublin/Pleasanton, California after taking the midnight BART train from Castro Valley to back here (and I hiked otherwise). While I was at my dad&#8217;s house, I was too distracted to pack my bag of home grown dried cannabis flowers, wood pipe, and butane lighter into my backpack. (I found out that I did not have the weed smoking supplies while I was riding on the last train ride of the night). I have been meaning to minimize my exposure to carcinogens and other health hazards, so maybe this is &#8220;the universe conspiring&#8221; to help me achieve that end as efficiently as possible (especially after communicating to &#8220;the universe&#8221; that is what I want with sufficient clarity and redundancy). I will definitely make room in my life for <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrooms</a> (ideally at least once per month). I do not have as much of a legitimate &#8220;need&#8221; for cannabis as I used to, but I will likely continue to indulge in it if the opportunity arrives (and quite fiendishly so). Still, it has been several months since I have used cannabis in pill or edible format (and that always delivers the longer lasting and &#8220;deeper&#8221; highs compared to smoking cannabis).</p>
