<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Warning: the following content is not meant to be taken too seriously and was written in order to get some ugly, depressing &#8220;baggage&#8221; in the author&#8217;s subconscious out of the way so that fresher and more inspiring thought processes can flow. (Scroll to the highlighted paragraphs near the bottom of this web page for details).</span></p>

<p><em>Women tend to shrilly mumble while failing to clearly enunciate their words and while vocalizing in a monotone, brittle tone and timber making as little effort to project their voices as possible. They tend to speak in a sulky and truncated manner which lacks passion, charisma, and intellectual depth. They tend to lack confidence and implicitly lean on a man as backup because they lack authority, autonomy, and worldly experience.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>Women tend to promote censorship of communications which they find personally offensive and, hence, seem unable and unwilling to take a relatively objective and logical position when dealing with what they seem to think is controversial subject matter. Rather than generate specific and evidence based arguments using original conscious thought, women tend to parrot &#8220;politically correct&#8221; slogans and trending buzzwords in a rather automatic and emotionally driven manner rather than come up with unique, clever, and witty responses which are not dripping in sarcasm, moralism, and woundedness. Women tend to prevent debates from getting nuanced, lengthy, and informative because they tire easily and become too emotionally upset to deploy logic in an impersonal, detached, and strategic manner (which means that women have to be treated like fragile, mentally unstable, and easily offended brats who will call upon authorities and human resources personnel to suppress speech which those brats find offensive (and the brats are supposed to always be given preferential treatment in compensation for how mentally weak they are (perhaps as an implicit apology for how badly they were maimed via sexual selection over many generations))).</em></p>

<p><em>Unlike many other animals (especially mammals), adult human females have been sexually selected for phenotypal traits which make them appear to be in permanent estrus and permanently pregnant in a way which is immediately visible even from a distance. Their bodies tend to be shaped in hideously non aerodynamic ways with bones which are much weaker than adult male human bones, with musculature which is much less defined than what adult male humans have, with significantly more subcutaneous fat than what adult male humans have, and with child sized bones, lungs, vocal chords, hands, and brains which have less neurons (particularly gray matter in the prefrontal cortex (which is what is used for abstract reasoning and conscious decision making)) than what adult male humans have. In short, adult female humans are hyper specialized exclusively for advertising their fertility and their subservience to men (which renders women prostitutes and baby makers by default (to the extent that it is relatively rare throughout human history for women to do much other than passively get transferred as a piece of property from one man to another man while getting raped and impregnated on the a man&#8217;s whim (and, unlike most mammalian species on Planet Earth, humans have had a relatively high chance of dying as a consequence of giving birth))). What this suggests is that the human species evolved to render women disposable replicators of a man&#8217;s DNA for the glory of the man while the woman is sacrificed for that end.</em></p>

<p><em>Women have historically been prevented from becoming educated and skilled in trades and recreational activities other than sexual reproduction, prostitution, and domestic servitude (which means women have less to think about and talk about than men do). Hence, women tend to lack conversational depth, worldly talents, confidence, humor, intellectual rigor, and physical strength and stamina. They are like fragile little lap dogs which are not suitable for hunting, sled pulling, and combat. They need to constantly be guarded by stronger, smarter beings so that they do not fall prey to their own stupidity and/or get kidnapped, tortured, maimed, or killed. Without a guardian, they cannot relax because they are unable to defend themselves against predators.</em></p>

<p><em>Women tend to dress in a manner which prevents them from being able to readily take on strenuous physical activity or endure environmental conditions outside of a temperature controlled and indoor environment. Without such a container, they tend to &#8220;melt&#8221; into ineffective and burdensome waifs. Most of them suck at being athletic and outdoorsy (which means they are boring, high maintenance, physically unfit, unadventurous, inexperienced with life outside the brothel, and helpless in emergency situations).</em></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Of course there are probably many exceptions to what I said in the previous paragraphs (and I might be outright wrong about some or all of what I said). I said those things to get it &#8220;out of my system&#8221; hopefully once and for all so that I can move on to subjects I think are much more worthwhile, interesting, productive, and fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Thanks to modern technology and more culturally and informational diversity, female bodied humans have increasingly accessible and reliable access to technologies such as birth control (especially non-hormonal interuterine devices), cross gender hormones (such as testosterone for those who wish to masculinize their phenotype), the same educational, vocational, and recreational opportunities which men have, and clothing styles which enable them to dress in ways which exude professionalism rather than crassness, fragility, and innocence. I personally think that gender nonconformist people are more attractive than those who rigidly conform to either the masculine or else the feminine extreme (and I think the feminine extreme is most ugly because such fashion is hyper sexualizing to the extent that it makes it hard to see women as anything but whores and welfare queens who use their motherhood status to garner social and economic support).</span></p>
