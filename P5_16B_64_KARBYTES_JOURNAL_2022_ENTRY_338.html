<p>I deleted the social media posts I made within the past three weeks in which I complain and/or request that people send me money via the PayPal donation link on my personal website and comment on what they see when they attempt to visit that website (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) because I was afraid that my website was being censored such that only I and a few other persons could see it from my Twitter, Minds, Instagram, and Facebook accounts (but I did not bother taking screenshots of those updated social media profiles because (a) I am trying to save server space and (b) I think those screenshots are starting to look redundant (and my patience for redundancy in my web content is going down as my sense of adamancy about making my lifestyle better is going up)). (I also deleted the social media post sharing <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_331/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry number 331</a> of the Karbytes 2022 Journal section of this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com) because I thought that journal entry was promoting that everyone be too limited in terms of what they can do in terms of making money, saving it, and spending it. <span style="background:#ffff00;">My idea for an alternative economic system would ensure that everyone gets the same basic income but it does not allow people to get much more than that (though that might be necessary if what tokens are used to purchase is especially scarce in supply). Getting &#8220;bonus&#8221; vouchers to purchase specific commodities instead of getting extra tokens in exchange for &#8220;working&#8221; (instead of opting out of &#8220;working&#8221; while getting paid only the universal basic income amount of tokens) is &#8220;too limiting&#8221; because people want to be able to work to earn limitlessly many tokens which would enable those exceptionally high earners to buy up sought after commodities which are in limited supply faster than their competitors can (and being able to &#8220;earn&#8221; that kind of preferential treatment as user of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capitalism</a> seems to prevent people from becoming depressed over the notion of not being to do much other than subsist on a fixed income</span>).</p>
<p>I see that the 16B chapter of the Karbytes 2022 Journal section of this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com) is at what I would deem to be (almost) &#8220;full capacity&#8221; in terms of the number of bytes of data I expect the zip file containing the entire chapter&#8217;s corresponding GitHub repository content to be. Hence, I will go ahead and make this the second to last journal entry in chapter 16B and make the last journal entry of this chapter link to 16C. (I will leave 16B pinned to the top of my Twitter and Minds profiles, however, until 31_DECEMBER_2022 or later).</p>
