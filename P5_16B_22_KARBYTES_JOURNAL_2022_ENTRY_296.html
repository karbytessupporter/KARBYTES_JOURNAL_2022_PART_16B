<p>MULTIVERSE:</p>
<p>– Multiple frames of reference which appear to inhabit the same universe seem to experience unique rates of time passing.</p>
<p>– Solipsism is the perception and/or belief that there exists only one frame of reference for the duration of that frame of reference’s existence.</p>
<p>– According to the “many world’s hypothesis”, there are as many parallel universes as there are unique outcomes to every decision (and one universe splits into multiple universes when a decision is made).</p>
<hr>
<p>HEDONISM:</p>
<p>– Hedonism is a basic heuristic which an information processing agent deploys in order to minimize how much that information processing agent suffers and/or to maximize how much pleasure that information processing agent experiences.</p>
