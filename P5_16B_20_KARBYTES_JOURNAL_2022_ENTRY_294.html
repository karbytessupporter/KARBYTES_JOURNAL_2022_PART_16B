<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Until every human is guaranteed an unconditional minimal weekly income from the government, every human is either a hostage or else a slave (and a hostage or a slave is indebted to humans other than itself (and by indebted I mean coerced into conforming to the desires of those other humans at the threat of being deprived of basic necessities, comforts, and other &#8216;civil liberties&#8217;)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Some humans think that most humans need to be forced to work or else be reduced to a beggar so that those humans have an incentive to earn their keep by providing a service which other humans so are willing to pay for. It can be argued that such work ensures that humans do not become too lazy nor too selfish to avoid becoming depressed, unable to properly care from themselves, and a burden to other humans to pay for in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_2: &#8220;karbytes_1 fails to mention that robots can perform most of the essential labor needed to sustain human civilization. Hence, humans would be permitted to become as lazy and as selfish as they want to so long as they do not violate other people&#8217;s civil liberties. Then all humans can enjoy (or waste) an unconditional minimal weekly income from the government.&#8221;</p>
