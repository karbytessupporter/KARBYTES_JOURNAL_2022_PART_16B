<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2022_ENTRY_295</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I remember something from my childhood: &#8220;hallucinating&#8221; that there were cars driving through my house from &#8220;the toy room&#8221; (i.e. the downstairs bedroom where my maternal grandfather currently resides) to the fireplace in &#8220;the family room&#8221; and then going vertically up the chimney. I wonder if that hallucination was me getting &#8220;prophetic&#8221; glimpses into my future decades later as a vagrant living next to the 580 freeway in Dublin for years at a time. The significance of this journal entry is that it may be used as evidence to suggest that time is an illusion and that time is &#8220;contained&#8221; (i.e. maintained as a virtual object which can be abstractly described as a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vector</a>) within my memories at the &#8220;end user&#8221; level (i.e. my first-person experience of space and time with time flowing in one direction at what seems to be a constant rate (perhaps as clock cycles per second or, even more subjectively, simulation rendering frames per second)).</p>
