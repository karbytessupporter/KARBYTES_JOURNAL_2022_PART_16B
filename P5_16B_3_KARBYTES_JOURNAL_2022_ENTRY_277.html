<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following hyperlink leads to a copy of the author&#8217;s primary website (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) which was made on 23_OCTOBER_2022. That copied website has some syntax errors (e.g. mispelled words) and semantic errors (e.g. ambiguously labeled diagram components (i.e. one diagram component label being used to refer to multiple components of the same diagram)). The author tentatively plans to get each of the web pages which are currently part of the entire primary website in a finalized format before 01_JANUARY_2023 (and web pages may be added to or removed from that website before 01_JANUARY_2023). The author tentatively plans to only add new web pages to that website one at a time after the year 2022.</span></p>
