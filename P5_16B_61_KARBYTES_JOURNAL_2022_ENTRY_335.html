<p>For approximately $80 per month, the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://www.publicstorage.com/self-storage-ca-castro-valley/1512?pid=wyelp&amp;CID=1245&amp;CHID=AFL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Storage</a> in Castro Valley provides 5 foot by 5 foot storage units which are approximately 10 feet in height (and the gate is open between 6:00AM to 9:00PM Monday through Sunday). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I do not feel sufficiently comfortable leaving my backpack in either one of my parents&#8217; cars or houses unattended by me</span> because I think that is the most likely place for my personal belongings to go missing (based on the empirical evidence which I remember). I have noticed that many of the envelopes and packages which arrive to me by &#8220;snail mail&#8221; are delayed if not missing. For that reason, I plan to rent a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://www.maxrealestateexposure.com/po-box-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post Office box (i.e. P.O. Box)</a> as soon as I can afford to (and, based on what I have researched online, a P.O. box which I would need would be approximately $20 per month (for envelopes and not for boxes)). Seeing how important it is for me to receive documents such as W-2 forms and my renewed driver&#8217;s license on time and not stolen, I would choose to rent a P.O. box as a higher priority than is renting a Public Storage unit. (I would rent a storage unit which is big enough to house my bicycles considering the fact that my bicycle tires have been mysteriously punctured while leaving them unattended inside of my dad&#8217;s house and out on the driveway in front of his house (and I saw that someone tampered with the breaks such that the wheels could hardly turn while some strangers stood by smirking as though they were happy to see my bicycle not working)). I do not trust the <strong>residents <u>of</u></strong> (nor <strong>vagrants <u>in</u></strong>) Castro Valley (nor of or in Hayward (nor of or in almost any other city for)) to not tamper with the belongings which I leave in my bedroom, mail box, or anywhere else which is technically on or near my parents&#8217; property. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I suppose that the details described in this journal entry makes me effectively homeless.</span> (I suppose what would technically make me not homeless is renting or else owning a housing unit which which is only inhabited by the people which I give explicit permission to live with me or else to enter that home for as long as I rent or else own that housing unit. I do not pay money to rent a room at my father&#8217;s house (nor do I think I should have to pay rent for that room considering how little use I get out of that room and how frequently I have noticed personal belongings of mine going missing or else getting tampered with while left unattended by me on that house property and how dismissive people generally are (my parents included) of my expressed concerns. (I get the sense that people generally want me to feel silenced, suppressed, oppressed, violated, stolen from, harassed, humiliated, tortured, and sabotaged because they do not entirely approve of my past and present conduct nor of my ideological values and personal goals). <span style="background:#ffff00;">The only things which I pay for (while depending solely on my mother&#8217;s PayPal donations) are food, mobile phone coverage, BART fare, clothes, and other items which are for my personal use exclusively</span>).</p>
